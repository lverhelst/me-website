        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNgNBsCI4EA">Hey look buddy, I'm an (software) engineer. That means I solve problems, not problems like "What is beauty?" Because that would fall within the purview of your conundrums of philosophy. I solve practical problems, for instance:</a> how am I going to build myself a website. The answer? A bit by hand, a bit with a custom static website generator built by me, for me.
        <p>I set myself some restrictions when making this website: minimal frameworks & static pages only. This allows me to host this site on Azure using only a storage container and a CDN. It also forces me to make mistakes, from which I (hopefully) will learn.</p>
        <p>This website is generated using custom html templates that contain Django-like template tags (ex: <code>{%block%}</code>). The base template sets up the html headers and the sidebar, then the main content of each page is taken care of by the other templates that inherit from the base template. These sub-templates allow me to generate basic pages, parallax pages and basic sets of image pages that link together. These are generated by a python script that reads the /source/ directory, finds the templates, and applies them. Instances of the parallax and imagelist templates point to their respective .json files, which list the content required (images, text, metadata) to generate the final html pages</p>
